Project Overview
Surplus Saver is a no-code app built with Glide that connects sellers with surplus food to buyers. The goal is to reduce food waste and improve access to affordable meals, addressing SDG 2: Zero Hunger. The app integrates with Flutterwave for secure payments.

Key Features

Buyers:
- Browse available surplus food items
- Filter items by availability
- Click Buy Now to pay securely via Flutterwave

Sellers:
- Add new food items via a simple form
- Set price, quantity, and pickup times
- Manage active/inactive items

Technology Stack

- Google Sheets – Backend data storage (`items`, `orders`, `sellers`)  
- Flutterwave – Payment integration  
- PWA – Mobile app-like experience  

How It Works
1. Sellers add items to the app.  
2. Buyers browse items in the Shop screen.
